/*
Pseudocode for game function
-Write a function so that when the player clicks on instructions, a pop-up window with the 
instructions shows up
-Write a function so that when the player clicks on the choose rounds button, a drop down menu shows up 
 where they can pick their number of rounds (did not get to do)
-Write a function so that player can input their name into the game.(did not do)
-Write a function so that when player clicks "Game start", the game screen resets to a new game
-Write a function so that also when player clicks "Game start", the first color lights up
    -Write and function that loops through the colors everytime the player makes the right choices
        -and if the input is right, wait for the prompt for the next set of colors.
        -and if they make the wrong choice a message displays that they lost and can try again
    -The function for choosing the colors must be randomnly generated each time and increase in number 
    as the rounds go on.
    -Write a function to record the score as they go along in the game.
User Clicks "Start Game"
Game flashes a color
User replicates and "clicks" the same color
If color clicked is correct, game adds on another color to the first color
If color clicked is wrong, "Game Over" and game board/score resets to zero
ADD EVENT SO THAT WHEN USER CLICKS A SQUARE IT FLASHES THAT COLOR

//I am presented with a random series of button presses.
//Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
//I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
//If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so
//I can win the game by getting a series of 5 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
